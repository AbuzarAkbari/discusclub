                            Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami.<br>
                            This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime.<br>
                            Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime.
                            Like they're actually proud of that shit.<br>

                            Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear.<br>
                            Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine.<br>
                            You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water.<br>
                            We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown.<br>
                            However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I.<br>
                            We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.<br>

                            Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it?<br>
                            Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter
                            that shakes when you put quarters in it? No?<br>
                            Well, that's what you see at a toy store.<br>
